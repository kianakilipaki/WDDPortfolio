Ch 10 - Bugs and Debugging

Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.

JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict" . This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.

Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.

Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.

The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.

Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.

An error object is created when an exception occurs.

Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.

Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.
