Chapter 9 - BOM

The window object is the global object in a browser.

Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.

 alert , confirm() , and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.

The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable.

The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.

The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.

You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).

The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.

 document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.

Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.

The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout() method.

The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method.

The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.

localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White');
localStorage.getItem('name');
console.log(localStorage.name);
localStorage.removeItem('name');
delete localStorage.name;

addEventListener('storage', (event) => {
console.log(`The ${event.key} was updated from ${event.oldValue} to ${event.newValue} and saved in 
${event.storageArea}`) }, false);

localStorage.setItem('superman', JSON.stringify(hero);
superman = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('superman'));

HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies, including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.

 data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.

The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.

The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user gives permission.

The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.

Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.

The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.

The <audio> and <video> elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.

The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.

A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.
